# Co

A concurrency related (sort of) project dedicate to help developer ease the pain of dealing goroutine and 
channel when coding 2 more lines channel code become annoying.

`Co` provides a lot of (at least planning) helper function's and utils such as `AwaitAll` `AwaitAny` and 
Parallel execution mechanism with concurrency limitation.

If there are some concurrency patterns you would like me to implement and there is none available in
community or in go lib, you are more than welcome to open an issue.
